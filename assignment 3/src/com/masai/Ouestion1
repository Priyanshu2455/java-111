What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?

==> Static:- A block of code would be loaded into RAM before it is executed;
 Example:
 package com.masai;
static public class Song{
static String artist="Lata";
static String title="wande matram"

 static void play(){
System.out.println(artist+" is singing "+title);
}
public static void main(String[] args){

play();
}
}

Non-static:- A block of code would be loaded into RAM ,only when it is required to execute;
example--
package com.masai;
public class Song{
String artist;
String title;
void play(){
System.out.println(artist+" is singing "+title);
}
public static void main(String[] args){
Song track1=new Song();
track1.artist="Lata";
track1.title="wande matram";
track1.play();

}
}
